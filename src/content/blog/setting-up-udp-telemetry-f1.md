# Setting Up *Pits n' Giggles*

Getting started with *Pits n' Giggles* is super simple. Just follow the steps below and you'll be up and running in no time.

This guide covers setup for all modern F1 games including **F1 25**, with built-in support for **F1 telemetry** and **F1 25 UDP telemetry**.

## 📥 1. Download the App

Go to [www.pitsngiggles.com](https://www.pitsngiggles.com) and download the latest version of the app.
*Pits n' Giggles* is a lightweight **F1 telemetry dashboard** that requires no installation-just run and drive.

## 📁 2. Create a Folder for the App

Create a new folder anywhere on your system (e.g., Desktop, Documents, etc.), and copy the downloaded executable into that folder.

Example:

```
C:\Users\YourName\Documents\pits_n_giggles\
```

## 🚀 3. Run the App

Double-click the executable to launch it.
By default, *Pits n' Giggles* listens on **UDP port 20777**-this is the default port used by most **F1 telemetry tools**, including the official Codemasters F1 games.

If you don’t have anything else using that port, there’s no need to change it.

If you **do** need to change it, click the **Settings** button on the *Pits n' Giggles* homepage and enter your desired port number:

You should now see the app open in your browser or a message confirming it’s running. It’s now ready to receive live **F1 25 UDP telemetry data**.

## 🎮 4. Launch Your F1 Game

Start your F1 game-*Pits n' Giggles* supports **F1 2021** through **F1 25** (and future releases, as long as they follow the Codemasters UDP spec).

### Enable UDP Telemetry in Game:

1. Go to `Game Options > Settings > Telemetry Settings`
2. Set the following:

   * **UDP Telemetry**: `On`
   * **UDP Port**: `20777` (or the port you set in the app)
   * **UDP Send Rate**: `60Hz`
   * **UDP Format**: Choose your game version: `2023`, `2024` or `2025`
   * **Your Telemetry**: `Public`
   * **Show Names**: `On` (this enables driver names in the dashboard)

These settings ensure your game streams real-time **F1 telemetry data** to *Pits n' Giggles* over your local network.
