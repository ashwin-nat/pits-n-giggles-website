# Smarter Telemetry Debugging for *Pits n' Giggles*

While developing ***Pits n' Giggles***, my F1 sim racing app, debugging became a serious bottleneck. Every cycle meant:

- Launching the sim
- Triggering a scenario
- Pausing to add logs or breakpoints
- Alt-tabbing back to the IDE
- Restarting the sim

This repeated **context switching** between game and code created high **mental overhead** slowing progress, introducing bugs, and wasting time.

To solve this, I built two developer tools:

- `telemetry_recorder` - Captures live telemetry from the sim via UDP
- `telemetry_replayer` - Replays captured telemetry offline over UDP or TCP

Now, I can **record once**, and **debug forever** without ever restarting a race.

## Custom Binary Format

Initially, I had considered the standard pcap format where I capture packets, write to a standard pcap file and then replay from this file.
The benefit of this approach would've been that the file is innately compatible with wireshark.

PCAP format is a highly detailed and verbose format, that captures several nuances of packet traffic, and more importantly, wireshark supports it out of the box.
However, the code started become too complex, way too complex for a dev tool. This would've required a siginifant chunk of time to develop and test.
And since this is just a dev tool, it was not worth the effort.

Hence, a new custom simpler file format was defined, the .f1pcap file.

### File Header (12 bytes)

  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/>

### Packet Data Block

## Telemetry Recording Workflow

  widths={[300, 600, 1200]}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/>

*Telemetry Recording Process*

* Captures all UDP telemetry during a live sim session
* Timestamps and serializes each packet into a structured binary file
* Optional compression enabled via flags
* Can be versioned, archived, and reused

## Telemetry Replay Workflow

<Image
  src={telemetryReplayWorkflow}
  alt="Telemetry replay workflow"
  widths={[300, 600, 1200]}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/>

*Telemetry Replay Process with UDP and TCP Modes*

* Replays saved sessions as if they were live
* Supports **playback speed multipliers**
* **TCP mode** enables **reliable high-throughput** for stress testing (via congestion control)
* Can be run repeatedly for test automation or regression

## From Mental Overhead to Focused Flow

Before these tools:

<Image
  src={beforeWorkflow}
  alt="Before workflow"
  widths={[300, 600, 1200]}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/>

* High friction
* Lost focus
* Slower iteration

Now:

<Image
  src={beforeWorkflow}
  alt="After workflow"
  widths={[300, 600, 1200]}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/>

* No sim restarts
* No context switching
* Full control over playback and timing

## Feature Highlights

* **Record once, debug forever**
* **Replay saved sessions at any speed**
* **TCP mode** for high-fidelity stress tests
* **Optional compression** for large captures
* **Versioned binary format** with endianness and flag support
* **Reduced mental overhead** = faster iteration and fewer bugs

## Wrap-up

By decoupling live simulation from debugging, `telemetry_recorder` and `telemetry_replayer` have dramatically improved how I develop *Pits n' Giggles*. It's one of those internal tools that paid for itself almost instantly and continues to save me hours every week.

I'm happy with the end result and with how much mileage I've got out of this tool. Would have I done anything differently given everything I've learned since then?
I probably would've added a checksum field to the header, making the file more robust, and also making the header a nice satisfying 16 bytes.
For a dev tool, I think this does the job as is.

If you're building anything real-time or stream-based, building a similar telemetry pipeline will radically simplify your workflow.
Trust me, you'll thank me later

Record once. Replay forever. Focus on what matters.
