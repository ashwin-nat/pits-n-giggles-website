# How to Use *Pits n' Giggles* for a Remote Race Engineer Setup (No Lobby Slot Needed!)

Want to bring a real-time **race engineer** into your sim racing experience-even if they're in a different city or country? With *Pits n' Giggles* and a virtual LAN tool like **Radmin**, you can stream **UDP telemetry** from your racing game (like **F1 25 telemetry**) to your engineer over the internet-**without them needing to join your game lobby**.

This is a game-changer: the **F1 series limits online lobbies to 22 slots**, which are usually filled by drivers. With this solution, your race engineer can monitor your performance, make strategic calls, and give live feedback **without occupying a player slot or spectating in-game**.

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- **Driver PC (You):**
  - Sim game like F1 25, F1 24, F1 23, with **UDP telemetry output** enabled.
  - *Pits n' Giggles* setup and running ([get it here](/releases)).
- **Engineer PC (Them):**
  - Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- **VPN software:**
  - Recommended: [Radmin](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/)

---

## üéØ Why This Setup is Better

- **No need to join the game lobby.**
- **No slot used in the 22-player cap.**
- **No spectating required.**
- **Real-time access to full telemetry data.**
- **Works from anywhere in the world.**

Your engineer stays off the track and out of the game, but still gets **real-time UDP telemetry**, including:

- Lap times
- Sector deltas
- Tyre wear and prediction
- Fuel levels and prediction
- ERS deployment
- And more

All via a web-based dashboard powered by *Pits n' Giggles*.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install VPN on Both PCs

To simulate being on the same local network, install **Radmin** or another VPN tool on both the **driver** and **engineer** machines.
And then click on the giant *ON* button

  alt="Radmin Main UI"
  widths={[300, 600, 1200]}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/>

- The **Driver** creates a new network in Radmin. (Network -> Create Network). Choose a unique network name and a password

  alt="Radmin Create Network"
  widths={[300, 600, 1200]}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/>

- The **Engineer** joins that same network using the same network ID and password.

  alt="Radmin Create Network"
  widths={[300, 600, 1200]}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/>

- Now you should be able to see 2 devices in the same network. Share your Radmin IP address with your engineer

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start *Pits n' Giggles* and Enable Game Telemetry

- Launch your racing game (e.g., F1 25).
  - Enable **UDP telemetry** (port 20777 by default).
- Start *Pits n' Giggles* on your PC ([installation guide](/setting-up-udp-telemetry-f1)).

You‚Äôll see something like:

```

Server running on [http://127.0.0.1:4768](http://127.0.0.1:4768)

```

This is your **localhost IP**-but for remote access, use your Radmin IP address.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Engineer Connects to Your Radmin IP

After establishing the network, the engineer can copy the driver's VPN IP address by right clicking their PC name and click "Copy Address"

Have your engineer open this in their browser:

```

http://<your-radmin-ip-addr>:4768

```

Example:

```

[http://25.124.87.33:4768](http://25.124.87.33:4768)

```

<Image
  src={connectedToRemoteDashboard}
  alt="Connected to Remote Dashboard"
  widths={[300, 600, 1200]}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/>
No need to touch the game lobby. Your engineer sees everything in real-time, without impacting lobby performance.

Alternatively, the driver can share the IP address that will be displayed in the Pits n' Giggles launcher window console log

  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"/>

```bash
2025-07-26 13:45:23,405 [INFO] - Starting F1 telemetry server. Open one of the below addresses in your browser
    http://127.0.0.1:4768       <----- This is your loopback/self address, not interested
    http://192.168.0.127:4768   <----- This is your LAN address, not interested
    http://25.49.182.29:4768    <----- This is your VPN address, this is what we want
    http://localhost:4768       <----- This is your loopback/self address, not interested
```

## üß™ Troubleshooting Tips

- Engineer can‚Äôt connect?
  - Make sure port **4768** is open in your firewall.
  - Test by pinging your Radmin IP.
  - Try disabling antivirus/firewall temporarily (simplest and brute force solution).

- VPN not working?
  - Try:
    - [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/)
    - [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)
    - [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/)
    - [Non VPN solution - using Playit.gg](/blog/remote-race-engineering-playitgg)
