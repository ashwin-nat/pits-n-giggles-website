## Download Pits n' Giggles
Pits n' Giggles is a free and open source F1 sim racing app and can be downloaded from [www.pitsngiggles.com](/releases)
Once downloaded, [configure the app](/blog/setting-up-udp-telemetry-f1) to work with the F1 game (supported games are F1 23 onwards)

## 🛠️ Quick Setup: Enable the Tyre Delta Trigger

To start using Tyre Delta, you only need to set up a quick custom notification in the game and match it in **Pits n' Giggles**.

### In F1 25:

1. Open the in-game settings.
2. Find the **UDP Custom Notification** section.
3. Assign **any UDP action code (1–12)** to a button on your wheel or controller.
4. We recommend **action code 11**, as that's the default used by Pits n' Giggles.

### In *Pits n' Giggles*:

1. Open the settings page in the Pits n' Giggles launcher window.

## 🚨 How to Use Tyre Delta Mid-Race

Once it's set up, using Tyre Delta is as easy as pressing a button - literally.

### While Racing:

1. **Hit the trigger button** (the one you bound to the UDP action code).
2. *Pits n' Giggles* reads your current tyre compound and lap data.
3. It calculates the time difference between your tyres and **fresh sets of the other two types**:

   * **Slicks**
   * **Intermediates**
   * **Wets**
4. This delta data is:

   * Sent to your **telemetry dashboard**, and
   * Read out loud using **text-to-speech**, so you don’t have to take your eyes off the track.

## 🧪 Real Example: Intermediates on a Drying Track

Let’s say you’re mid-race on **intermediates**, but the rain has stopped and the track is gradually drying. You’re not sure if it's the right time to switch to slicks - going too early could mean losing grip and time, but waiting too long could cost you valuable seconds.

### Here’s how Tyre Delta helps:

* You press your assigned button to trigger the feature.
* Pits n' Giggles analyzes your performance on intermediates versus the best recent lap from cars on slicks and wets.
* You hear:

> "*Slicks are faster than intermediates by 0.5 seconds. Wets are slower than intermediates by 4.9 seconds*"

That’s your cue. The slicks are clearly the better option now. **Box at the next opportunity** and gain the time advantage!
