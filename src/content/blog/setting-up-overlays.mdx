# 🎉 Introducing the New In-Game HUD / Overlay for *Pits n' Giggles*

> *A powerful, customizable, real-time racing HUD — built for immersion, clarity, and performance.*

> **[PLACEHOLDER: hero image of full HUD]**

The latest update of **Pits n' Giggles** brings one of the most requested features:
a fully in-game **HUD / overlay system** designed to give sim racers the information they need *without ever leaving the track*.

This post walks you through all the new overlay components, how they work, and how you can customise them to your liking.

## 🚦 Timing Tower Overlay

> **[PLACEHOLDER: timing tower screenshot]**

The new **Timing Tower** delivers broadcast-style visibility right inside your race.

It displays:

- **Position**
- **Team**
- **Driver name**
- **Tyre compound**
- **Max tyre wear %** (the most worn tyre in the set)
- **ERS mode**
- **ERS percentage remaining**
- **DRS availability & activation**
- **Time penalties**

Everything updates live and remains readable even at racing pace.

## ⏱️ Lap Timer Overlay

> **[PLACEHOLDER: lap timer screenshot]**

The **Lap Timer** shows:

- **Best lap**
- **Last lap**
- **Current lap**
- **Sector colours for the current lap**

### 💡 Dynamic Sector Colours (New!)
Unlike the sim’s built-in UI, sector colours here are **dynamic**.

A sector that initially goes purple can later be **demoted to green** if you improve relative to your own best.
It behaves more like a real-world timing system and makes feedback far more meaningful.

## 📟 Multi-Function Display (MFD)

> **[PLACEHOLDER: MFD overview screenshot]**

Your in-game **MFD** now includes several pages of detailed telemetry and predictive insights, computed live from your data stream.

### ▶️ Collapsed / Default Mode
Compact view that uses minimal screen space, ideal for when the MFD is “closed.”

- Lap times
- Sector times
- Sector colours

Perfect for spotting short-term performance trends.
