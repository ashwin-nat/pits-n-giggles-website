# 🏎️ Fuel Strategy Planning in F1 Sim Racing Using Pits n' Giggles

In **F1 sim racing**, nailing your fuel strategy is *absolutely essential*-not just to avoid running out of fuel, but to **optimize performance over the entire race**. The less fuel you carry, the lighter your car. And a lighter car means:
- **Better acceleration out of corners**
- **Reduced tyre wear**
- **Faster lap times over a stint**

Carrying just the right amount of fuel can be the difference between winning your race and limping to the finish. That’s why **Pits n' Giggles**, a race engineering companion built specifically for **F1 Sim Racing**, includes a powerful **fuel usage analysis and real-time prediction system**.

If you're curious how this works under the hood, check out our deep dive:

## 🧰 Requirements

- **Driver PC (You):**
  - Sim game like F1 25, F1 24, F1 23, with **UDP telemetry output** enabled.
  - *Pits n' Giggles* setup and running ([get it here](/releases)).

## 🔧 Step-by-Step: Building a Race-Fit Fuel Strategy

To get the most from the **fuel calculator** in Pits n' Giggles, follow this tried-and-tested method during your **F1 league racing** prep:

### ✅ Step 1: Setup a Representative Practice Session

Start an online session that mimics your upcoming race weekend:
- Use **Grand Prix (GP) or Free Practice (FP) mode** with the correct race length: **25%, 50%, or 100%**.
- Fit the expected **race tyre compound**-usually **Mediums** or **Hards**.
- Begin with approximately **40 kg** of fuel in the car.

Then, go out and drive **7–8 clean, consistent laps**:
- Use **DRS** when available.
- Use **ERS** (overtake mode) conservatively-just as you would in a race. Maintain your ERS levels as you would in the race after say lap 5.
- Focus on race pace, not qualifying pace. The goal is to create **reliable telemetry data** that reflects real race conditions.

> 🧪 These laps form the foundation for accurate fuel modeling. Speed doesn’t matter-consistency does.

This is the type of prep real engineers do for **F1 esports and sim racing championships**-and now, so can you.

### ✅ Step 2: Use the Fuel Calculator in Pits n' Giggles

After completing your stint and letting Pits n’ Giggles capture the session’s telemetry:

1. Open the **Driver/Engineer View**.
2. Click your **driver name** to bring up detailed telemetry data.
3. Switch to the **“Fuel Usage”** tab.

#### 🧠 Select Representative Laps

Because the app can’t automatically detect in-laps, out-laps, or cooldown laps, it’s up to you to manually select **only the valid race laps** using the checkboxes in the lap list.

This limitation exists because the **F1 25 game’s UDP telemetry output does not provide any flags or markers indicating the type of lap**. There’s no reliable way to distinguish between a push lap and a cooldown lap programmatically. As a result, **Pits n’ Giggles gives you full control** over which laps are used for fuel modeling-ensuring your strategy is based only on meaningful, representative data.


Then:
- Input the **total race lap count**.
- (Optional) Fine-tune with advanced settings:

    | Field | Description | Recommended Value |
    |-------|-------------|-------------------|
    | Surplus Laps | Safety buffer | 0.5–1.0 (default: 1) |
    | Predicted Safety Cars | Number you expect | 0–2 |
    | SC Fuel Burn Rate (%) | % of race burn during SC | 50–70% |
    | Lift-Coast Fuel Saving (%) | Saving from LiCo | 3–5% |

NOTE: Any saving more than 5% through LiCo is probably going to result in significant loss of pace!

This is far more customizable-and **far more accurate**-than the simplistic surplus-lap estimate used by the **in-game F1 25 fuel calculator**.

## 🧮 Why Pits n' Giggles Beats the In-Game Fuel Calculator

The default **fuel prediction in F1 25** is based on a static, one-size-fits-all burn rate. It ignores your:
- Setup
- Driving style
- Track layout
- Use of ERS or DRS

You’re forced to guess how many extra laps of fuel you’ll need-often ending up way too heavy or dangerously light.

**Pits n' Giggles** solves this by building a **telemetry-driven fuel model**, powered by your actual race pace:
- Captures data from **live telemetry** or saved stints
- Models fuel burn per lap based on real inputs
- Adjusts predictions dynamically over time

This approach mirrors what real teams do in **F1 telemetry analysis**, and it's especially powerful in **league racing** where the margins are razor-thin.

> 💡 Since practice data is gathered in **clean air and with high fuel**, predictions are naturally conservative. On race day, you’ll benefit from slipstream and lower fuel weight, often burning slightly *less* than predicted.

## 🎁 Bonus: Monitor Fuel Live During the Race

If you're running **Pits n’ Giggles live during the race**, the **Laps column** in the telemetry view gives you real-time feedback to help adjust on the fly. It includes:

| Field | What it shows |
|-------|----------------|
| **Last** | Fuel burned on the last lap (in kg) |
| **Laps** | Surplus or deficit of laps worth of fuel remaining |
| **Tgt** | Target fuel burn for the current lap |

### 🧠 Example:
If:
- `Last = 1.5 kg`
- `Tgt = 1.4 kg`

...then you're burning slightly more than planned, and should consider **saving fuel** using:
- Lift-and-coast techniques
- Short-shifting
- Minimizing ERS deployment

If the **Laps** value turns negative, you’re at risk of not finishing-save aggressively or plan for an early push and late coast.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

Fuel strategy in **F1 sim racing** is more than just avoiding a DNF. It's about maximizing pace, minimizing weight, and making every drop count. With **Pits n’ Giggles**, you have access to tools that mimic what real-world teams use in **race engineering**-from accurate **telemetry-based fuel calculators** to **live burn monitoring**.

Take the guesswork out of your **F1 25 league races**, and start driving like the pros.
