          <p class="mb-0">
            Pits n' Giggles is designed with privacy as a core principle. The application runs entirely on your local machine, 
            collects no personal data, and sends no telemetry or analytics data to our servers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Pits n' Giggles Application</h3>
        <p>
          The Pits n' Giggles application itself collects <strong>zero personal information</strong>. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No user accounts:</strong> The app requires no registration or login</li>
          <li><strong>No telemetry:</strong> We don't track how you use the app</li>
          <li><strong>No analytics:</strong> No usage statistics are collected or transmitted</li>
          <li><strong>No crash reports:</strong> Error data stays on your machine</li>
          <li><strong>No automatic updates:</strong> The app doesn't phone home for updates</li>
          <li><strong>Local data only:</strong> All race data and settings remain on your computer</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Website Analytics (pitsngiggles.com)</h3>
        <p>
          Our website uses analytics services to understand how visitors use our site and improve the user experience:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Collects anonymous usage data including pages visited, 
            time spent on site, geographic region (country/city level), and device information
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vercel Analytics:</strong> Provides basic page view statistics and performance metrics
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vercel Speed Insights:</strong> Monitors website performance and loading times
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These analytics services may use cookies and similar technologies. You can opt out of Google Analytics 
          by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Processing</h2>

        <h3>Application Data</h3>
        <p>
          All data generated by Pits n' Giggles (race sessions, lap times, telemetry data, settings) is stored locally on your computer. 
          This data never leaves your machine unless you explicitly choose to share it.
        </p>

        <h3>Saved Race Data</h3>
        <p>
          When you save race sessions, the data is stored as JSON files on your local filesystem. These files:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contain only racing telemetry data (lap times, tire wear, fuel usage, etc.)</li>
          <li>Do <strong>not</strong> include car setup data by default (for competitive privacy)</li>
          <li>Can be safely shared with others as they contain no personal information</li>
          <li>Are under your complete control - delete them anytime</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h3>GitHub</h3>

          We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any data to third parties, except:
        </p>
        <ul>
